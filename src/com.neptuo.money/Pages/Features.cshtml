    # Categories
    Your expenses are divided into categories that you define by yourself.<br>
    Each category has name and description.<br>
    To easily distinguish between categories each has a color and an icon.<br>

    # Currencies
    Your expenses are displayed in your primary currency.<br>
    But when you are abroad, you may pay in a different currency. <br>
    For this scenario Money supports different currencies and exchange rates between them.<br>
    Each currency has a ISO/unique code and a user display name.<br>
    When you have more than one currency, you can define exchange rates between them.<br>
    The idea is that when you exchange some amount to foreign currency, just log the rate with todays datd.<br>
    When you use foreign money to pay for something, add expense in different currency, the app will use the rate.<br>
