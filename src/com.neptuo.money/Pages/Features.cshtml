    # Categories
    Your expenses are divided into categories that you define by yourself.
    Each category has name and description.
    To easily distinguish between categories each has a color and an icon.

    # Currencies
    Your expenses are displayed in your primary currency.
    But when you are abroad, you may pay in a different currency. 
    For this scenario Money supports different currencies and exchange rates between them.
    Each currency has a ISO/unique code and a user display name.
    When you have more than one currency, you can define exchange rates between them.
    The idea is that when you exchange some amount to foreign currency, just log the rate with todays datd.
    When you use foreign money to pay for something, add expense in different currency, the app will use the rate.
